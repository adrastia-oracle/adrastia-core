- Add PeriodicPriceAccumulationOracle: An oracle contract similar to PeriodicAccumulationOracle, but with liquidity as constants to save gas.
- Add AbstractAggregatorOracle: An abstract implementation of IOracleAggregator, pulled out of AggregatedOracle so that different aggregator contracts can share common logic.
- Fill buffer metadata space to allow for extension and future use.
- Add HistoricalAggregatorOracle: An abstract oracle that aggregates historical observations from another oracle that implements IHistoricalOracle.
- Add MedianFilteringOracle: An oracle that performs median filtering on the price and liquidity of another oracle that implements IHistoricalOracle.
- Add PriceVolatilityOracle: An oracle that calculates and stores the historical price volatility (using log returns) of another oracle implementing IHistoricalOracle, with the help of VolatilityOracleView.
- Add AggregationPerformed event to the oracle aggregators.
- Remove hardcoded minimum values for observations in the oracle aggregators. These checks are better served in validation strategies.
####  Oracle views
- Add AccumulatorOracleView: An oracle contract that delegates to the oracle functionality of underlying price and liquidity accumulators.
- Add VolatilityOracleView: A volatility oracle view contract that uses data from an IHistoricalOracle implementation to calculate metrics relating to historical price volatility.

### Strategies
#### Aggregation strategies
- Add AbstractAggregator: A common base for aggregation strategies.
- Add MedianAggregator: Aggregates observations to form a median price and total liquidity.
- Add MeanAggregator: Aggregates observations to form a mean price and total liquidity. It delegates the averaging logic to an IAveragingStrategy implementation.
- Add TokenWeightedMeanAggregator: Aggregates observations to form a token-weighted mean price and total liquidity.
- Add QuoteTokenWeightedMeanAggregator: Aggregates observations to form a quote token-weighted mean price and total liquidity. This is the same strategy that the old AggregatedOracle contract used.
#### Averaging strategies
- Add AbstractAveraging: A common base for averaging strategies.
- Add ArithmeticAveraging: Computes averages using the arithmetic mean.
- Add GeometricAveraging: Computes averages using the geometric mean.
- Add HarmonicAveraging: Computes averages using the harmonic mean.

- Add HarmonicAveragingWS140: Like HarmonicAveraging, but shifts weights to the left by 140 bits.
- Add HarmonicAveragingWS192: Like HarmonicAveraging, but shifts weights to the left by 192 bits.
#### Validation strategies
- Add DefaultValidation: Validates observations against three conditions - minimum token liquidity value, minimum quote token liquidity, and liquidity distribution. It uses the same validation as the old AggregatedOracle contract.

Note: Delegation refers to the software engineering _delegation pattern_ rather than the EVM's delegation functionality.
